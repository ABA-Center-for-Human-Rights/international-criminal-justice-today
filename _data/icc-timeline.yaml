Following the adoption of the Convention, the General Assembly invited the International Law Commission to explore the possibility of establishing an international judicial organ to try those charged with genocide. The Commission concluded that such a judicial organ was both possible and desirable, and a subsequent committee drafted statutes in 1951 and 1954. Despite these early efforts, the General Assembly postponed considering the question, and the Cold War prevented further development of international criminal law for several decades."
