###Recent ABA’s ICC Project/Ipsos Polling Finds Positive Opinions on Palestinian Membership at the ICC

---

Washington, D.C., April 13, 2015 – More Americans than not believe Palestinian membership in the International Criminal Court has a long-term positive impact on the Israel-Palestine peace process, according to a poll by Ipsos Public Affairs and American Bar Association’s ICC Project.  Of those aware of the ICC, 35% thought there was a positive long-term impact on the peace process. Furthermore, more Americans than not believe that Palestine’s membership at the ICC advances international justice. Of Americans with knowledge of the ICC, 30% thought Palestine’s membership advances international justice. On overall perceptions of the ICC, nearly two-thirds of Americans agree on the importance of international organizations that support human rights and that hold individuals accountable for mass atrocities. In addition to these findings, the poll also resulted in a small uptick in Americans support for the ICC and its government supporting its work.
