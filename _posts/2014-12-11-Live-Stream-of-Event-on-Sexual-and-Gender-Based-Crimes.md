On December 11, 2014, American Bar Association's International Criminal Court Project will have an event entitled "*Prosecuting Sexual and Gender-Based Violence: New Directions in International Criminal Justice*" hosted at the Council on Foreign Relations. The event will feature a discussion with Madame Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Fatou Bensouda (The Gambia) and Ambassador David Scheffer, Mayer Brown/Robert A. Helman Professor of Law Northwestern University School of Law and former U.S. Ambassador at-large for War Crimes Issues. 

The following is a fuller description of the event:
 *During conflict, men, women and even children are often the targets of sexual or gender-based violence with disastrous effects on society. Though laws against atrocity crimes include language that prohibits and punishes sexual and gender-based crimes, prosecutions of such crimes have not occurred in proportionate numbers. This event will address why and how foreign policymakers can better combat sexual and gender-based violence, including through the promotion of international criminal justice.*
