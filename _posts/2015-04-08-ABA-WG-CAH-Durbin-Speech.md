###Senator Durbin to Reintroduce Crimes Against Humanity Legislation; Chair of the ABA Working Group on Crimes Against Humanity Commends Durbin's Initiative 

---

Chicago, Illinois, April 10, 2015 – In a [speech](http://www.law.northwestern.edu/about/news/newsdisplay.cfm?ID=712) at Northwestern University School of Law, U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) announced his intention to reintroduce Crimes Against Humanity (CAH) legislation in Congress, referring to the lack of such legislation as a “legal loophole”. Senator Durbin's speech laid out the history of Congresional successes in "building the law" on mass human rights violations. Yet, he stressed that more work needs to be done, particularly on CAH, “[d]espite longstanding U.S. support for the prosecution of crimes against humanity committed in World War II … in Pol Pot’s Cambodia, Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone and elsewhere … there is no U.S. law prohibiting crimes against humanity.” For this and other reasons, Senator Durbin announced his intention "to reintroduce the Crimes Against Humanity Act" in Congress.

Senator Durbin's initiative to reintroduce CAH legislation coincides with the recently formed ABA Working Group on CAH. In his speech, Senator Durban congratulated two Northwestern Law professors for their selection to the ABA Working Group, “[l]et me also say congratulations to both Ambassador [David] Scheffer and Professor [Juliet] Sorensen for their selection as members of the American Bar Association’s new Working Group on Crimes Against Humanity.” Commenting on the Senator's speech, the Chair of the Working Group, Ambassador David Scheffer, said, "Senator Durbin once again is taking the lead in the Senate to ensure that there exists no impunity gap in U.S. law for those who commit atrocity crimes.  His previous legislation on genocide, child soldiers, and human trafficking has set the stage for bringing to justice those who perpetrate crimes against humanity."
