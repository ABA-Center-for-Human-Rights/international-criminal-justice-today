On February 20, 2014, the University of Denver Sturm College of Law welcomed Kip Hale, director of the ABA-ICC Project, to give a talk at an event hosted by the College of Law’s International Law Society and the Ved Nanda Center for International and Comparative Law. In his talk on international criminal justice and the US role in the field, Kip Hale explained the undesirable consequences caused by the United States and other states not fully engaging with the ICC, and detailed adverse effects of obsolete anti-ICC legislations passed by US Congress in the early 2000's. In discussing the ICC's first twelve years of operations, Hale stated, “a prevalent issue that has come out of the international criminal court system is international cooperation and assistance. The Court does not have police forces to do these things; cooperation is essential.” Hale concluded by stating there was reason to be positive about the future of US-ICC relations. Despite past and current difficulties, U.S.-ICC relations are “not broken, but it needs to be worked on.” The full talk is available by clicking the link below.

> “When Churchill and Stalin were discussing who to summarily execute, it was FDR who stepped in to say that there would be no executions without due process of law. The United States has always been involved with these ideals.”

> “There are two main issues as I see it right now, the first is complementarity; this 	issue is incredibly important for the international community to figure out. The second is the relationship between the ICC and the states; it is not broken but it needs to be worked on.”
— Kip Hale
