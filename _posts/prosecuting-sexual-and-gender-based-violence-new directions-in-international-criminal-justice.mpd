**Prosecuting Sexual and Gender Based Violence: New Directions in International Criminal Justice**

New York, Dec. 11, 2014 – The American Bar Association’s (ABA) International Criminal Court (ICC) Project and the Council on Foreign Affairs are co-sponsoring an event today on the ICC’s newly released Policy on Sexual and Gender Based Crimes, and will feature a discussion between the Prosecutor of the ICC, Madame Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, and former U.S. Ambassador at-large for War Crimes Issues and U.N.’s Special Expert to the Khmer Rouge Trials, David Scheffer. The policy’s purpose is to inform and guide the Office of the Prosecutor’s entire operations in order to make them better attuned to sexual and gender based crime and related issues. Additionally, other issues of discussion will be recent atrocities committed in Syria and Iraq by Islamic State forces, and developments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Kenya cases at the ICC. 

The American Bar Association’s (ABA) International Criminal Court Project is an independent initiative of the ABA Center for Human Rights that advances international criminal justice and US-ICC relations through advocacy, education and practical legal assistance.
