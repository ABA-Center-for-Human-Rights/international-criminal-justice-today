The American Bar Association (ABA) Center for Human Rights is saddened by the passing of Judge Hans-Peter Kaul who recently retired as a judge of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, The Netherlands and expresses condolences to his family, colleagues and friends.

Judge Kaul was an inspiring advocate, a gentle man, and a seminal figure in the creation and development of the ICC, the world’s permanent court for investigating and adjudicating the international atrocity crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. An experienced diplomat of Germany who served his country and fellow citizens in a number of important diplomatic postings around the world, Judge Kaul in 1998 was a German delegate to the Rome Conference at which representatives from nearly 150 nations produced the Rome Statue that created the ICC, and was a prominent negotiator during deliberations of the Statute’s provisions. When the ICC began its operations in 2002 he was elected a judge of the Court by the Assembly of States Parties, a position he held for eleven years. Judge Kaul was also elected by his peers to serve as the ICC’s Second Vice-President during the period 2009-2012. 

ICC President Judge Sang-Hyun Song has reflected on the vital role played by his colleague Judge Kaul in the development of modern international criminal justice, recalling that “_[he] served as a role model, dedicating his career to reshaping international justice. Judge Kaul was a driving force in the creation of the Rome Statute, in the establishment of the ICC, and in many of the decisions rendered in the situations and cases before the Court in its history thus far. We will long remember him with respect and admiration on a personal and professional level, for his relentless commitment and extensive contributions to international justice._” 

Judge Kaul was an early supporter of the ABA-ICC Project and a strong advocate of improved relations between the United States and the International Criminal Court. Judge Kaul has left his indelible mark on the vitally important field of international criminal justice, for which we are indebted to him.
