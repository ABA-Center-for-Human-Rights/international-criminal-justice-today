On October 27, 2014, the American Bar Association (ABA) International Criminal Court (ICC) Project in conjunction with the Washington Working Group on the ICC and hosted by U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) organized a U.S. Senate briefing on the ICC. The off-the-record event featured remarks by the Prosecutor of the ICC, Fatou Bensouda and U.S. Ambassador at-large for Global Criminal Justice, Stephen Rapp, with introductory comments by senior counsel of the ABA Center for Human Rights and director of the ABA-ICC Project, Kip Hale.

In her remarks, Madame Prosecutor began discussing the Kenya cases at the ICC, in particular the lack of cooperation by the Kenyan government, on-going witness intimidation and evidence tampering, and the substantial amount of crime-based evidence already before the Court. Madame Prosecutor continued her remarks by discussing the on-going atrocities in Syria and Iraq, specifically roadblocks and avenues for the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) to exert jurisdiction in these countries. She concluded her remakrs by giving details about the OTP's new Policy on Sexual and Gender-Based Crimes, which was the result of two years of exhaustive internal ICC and external civil society consultations. She reaffirmed her personal as well as the OTP's professional commitment to combating these crimes.

Ambassador Rapp's remarks concentrated on how the U.S. government has supported international criminal justice, most notably *ad hoc* and hybrid international tribunals and domestic courts investigating and prosecuting international atrocity crimes. He concluded that while the preference should always be domestic accountability for such mass crimes, there is a need for a permanent international criminal tribunal given that the vast majority of atrocities go unaddressed by domestic courts.
To this end, Ambassador Rapp discussed how the U.S. government tries to assist the ICC and its work in accordance with U.S. law. Ambassador Rapp also elaborated on the evolution of international jurisprudence on sexual and gender based crimes, and how innovation is key to holding participants in such crimes accountable.

Questions from the floor focused on how best to investigate and prosecute sexual and gender based crimes, and how conflict minerals finance atrocities in the Democratic Republic of Congo and elsewhere in Africa.
