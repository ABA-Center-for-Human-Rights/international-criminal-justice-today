The International Criminal Court (ICC) is the _world's only permanent_ international court with a mandate to investigate and prosecute individuals who participate in the international atrocity crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The ICC's jurisdiction may expand in 2017 to include the crime of aggression. A multilateral treaty called the Rome Statute was adopted in 1998 and later established the ICC in 2002 once the 60th country ratified it. The ICC is an independent institution that is not a part of the United Nations (UN), but cooperates with the UN and its agencies. 

By law of the Rome Statute, the ICC may only investigate and prosecute when a national jurisdiction is "_unwilling or unable_" to do so themselves, and may only address the gravest crimes. Further, the Rome Statute and other core documents require the ICC to use the highest standards of due process and fair trial.

## What is in this section of the ABA-ICC Project website?

The following section of the website will delve deeper into the field of international criminal justice and the ICC, yet do so through graphics, timelines, maps, and other interactive visuals. Specifically, we will explore the ICC and its State Parties, jurisdiction, structure, judicial processes, current investigations and prosecutions, and other important information. Additionally, there are two helpful timelines: one that covers the history of international criminal justice, including temporary international tribunals; and the other looks into the evolution of relations between the United States and the ICC.

We encourage you to explore all of these features, and are eager to hear your comments and suggestions!
