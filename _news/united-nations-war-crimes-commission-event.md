#### American University Washington College of Law hosts panel discussion on UN War Crimes Commission.

Washington D.C., Aug. 7, 2013 - American University Washington College of Law hosted a panel of experts to discuss the utility, history, and impact of the United Nations War Crimes Commission (1943-48). The panelists discussed the exclusion of the public from the Commission’s archives, and the potential utility of publicizing the archives. Mr. Kip Hale, Director of the American Bar Association’s (ABA) International Criminal Court (ICC) Project who has previously litigated at international criminal tribunals, explained that the the archives would be useful in providing guidance for present and future international criminal trials. Kip stated that guidance would be helpful, and potentially necessary, because “we are never going to get rid of atrocities; it's just about how we deal with them in the aftermath.”
