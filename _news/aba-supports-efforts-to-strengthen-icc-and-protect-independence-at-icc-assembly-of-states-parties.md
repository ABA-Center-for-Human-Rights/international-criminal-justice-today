  The long-term success of the ICC, and its wide-reaching impact for victims,
  affected communities, national jurisdictions, and the international community,
  depend on the Court’s ability to continue to question, improve, and
  resiliently pursue its mission to fight impunity for atrocity crimes that
  still remain too often unaddressed and unchecked more than two decades after
  its establishment. The Court must be able to do this difficult job without
  fear of political interference in its investigations and decisions or
  persecution of its professionals because of their work on behalf of a global
  institution dedicated to international criminal justice.

**The Hague, The Netherlands, Dec. 3, 2019:**&nbsp;On the occasion of the 18th Session of the Assembly of States Parties (ASP) to the International Criminal Court (ICC), the American Bar Association (ABA) reaffirmed its support for the International Criminal Court as the cornerstone of a global system of justice for atrocity crimes.&nbsp;

In a written statement submitted on behalf of the ABA, Past President of the ABA and Chair of the ICC Project&nbsp;[Michael S. Greco](https://www.aba-icc.org/board-of-advisors/michael-s-greco/)&nbsp;noted that the envisioned court-wide review of the ICC aimed at strengthening the Court's procedures and effectiveness, which will be discussed throughout this Assembly, is a opportunity to address the Court's challenges. Greco encouraged States Parties and independent experts (a group of which is expected to be authorized to address certain topics as part of a review) to engage diverse voices and to involve Court officials/staff and civil society, who have unique perspectives on the Court's challenges and potential solutions. Elsewhere during the ASP, the ICC Project co-hosted a side event highlighting on the unique perspectives that victims, affected communities, and civil society organizations can contribute to this process.

> "This initiative has the potential to have a lasting impact on the Court’s history, but its impact will depend on the support and openness of all involved, including the Assembly of States Parties, Court leadership, experts and civil society. We must all be accountable for staying true to the ICC’s purposes and guiding principles while also questioning where it has fallen short and can do better to fulfill them." - Michael S. Greco

Greco also stressed the continued need for all stakeholders to protect the independence of the Court's legal professionals and its casework, including from political interference.
