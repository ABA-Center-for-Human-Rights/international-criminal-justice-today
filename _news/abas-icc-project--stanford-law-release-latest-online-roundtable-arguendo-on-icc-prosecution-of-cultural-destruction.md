Washington D.C., June 22, 2016 - The [American Bar Association’s International Criminal Court (ICC) Project](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.aba-2Dicc.org_&amp;d=CwMGaQ&amp;c=imBPVzF25OnBgGmVOlcsiEgHoG1i6YHLR0Sj_gZ4adc&amp;r=i_MXAE22YmAIqCgKCr6N3g&amp;m=UIjULAewBE2TkVeH4HcoSDjt-D3RIvLfIF1ubs6xlio&amp;s=Isr6v7GYfJljJsG1QsD3FtL5LtqRGgfGs3Z2JR4mpKE&amp;e=) and [Stanford Law School Program in International and Comparative Law](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__law.stanford.edu_stanford-2Dprogram-2Din-2Dinternational-2Dand-2Dcomparative-2Dlaw_&amp;d=CwMGaQ&amp;c=imBPVzF25OnBgGmVOlcsiEgHoG1i6YHLR0Sj_gZ4adc&amp;r=i_MXAE22YmAIqCgKCr6N3g&amp;m=UIjULAewBE2TkVeH4HcoSDjt-D3RIvLfIF1ubs6xlio&amp;s=vb-9QF_POJoqchbMNuk_NJrRt-FmVuAiLEyjN1JVAqk&amp;e=) are pleased to announce the release of their latest online roundtable, [*Arguendo*](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.international-2Dcriminal-2Djustice-2Dtoday.org_arguendo_&amp;d=CwMGaQ&amp;c=imBPVzF25OnBgGmVOlcsiEgHoG1i6YHLR0Sj_gZ4adc&amp;r=i_MXAE22YmAIqCgKCr6N3g&amp;m=UIjULAewBE2TkVeH4HcoSDjt-D3RIvLfIF1ubs6xlio&amp;s=xPF2SQHpSd9BY9Iq8xNAbvoyHx382jMOnlLQLUaedDw&amp;e=), with an eminent panel of experts discussing the significance of the ICC’s war crime charges of attacks on cultural property in Mali. The ICC's case against extremist Mr. Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi for alleged attacks on the World Heritage site of Timbuktu in Mali and other artifacts of cultural heritage is a milestone for the Court: the first trial to focus on alleged cultural destruction, as well as the first case to include a guilty plea, as Mr. al-Mahdi will [reportedly](http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/06/01/world/europe/ap-eu-international-court-mali.html?_r=0) enter in the near future.

<br>To discuss this emerging facet of international criminal justice, this&nbsp;*Arguendo*roundtable features contributions from six distinguished experts: ‪‎UNESCO Director-General, Irina Bokova; former ‎US Ambassador to the Netherlands and Georgetown Diplomacy Professor, Ambassador Cynthia Schneider; former Prime Minister of Australia and President of Asia Society Policy Institute, Honorable Kevin Rudd; his Royal Highness Prince El Hassan bin Talal of Jordan; and Gilles Dutertre & Sam Shoamanesh of the ICC Office of the Prosecutor.

In her article, Director-General Bokova [discusses](/_arguendo/ending-impunity-for-war-crimes-on-cultural-heritage-the-mali-case.md) the legal validity of prosecuting cultural destruction as a war crime and the resulting collaboration between UNESCO and the ICC. Ambassador Schneider [explores](/_arguendo/why-culture-matters.md) the importance of protecting the unique identity of Timbuktu through the restoration of cultural heritage. Prime Minister Rudd [argues](/_arguendo/protecting-our-global-culture.md) for the need to increase coordination and collaboration between international actors, including states, law enforcement, and museums, in the fight to protect global culture and history. His Royal Highness Prince El Hassan [emphasizes](/_arguendo/promoting-intercultural-dialogue-through-safeguarding-cultural-heritage.md) the role that cultural appreciation has in fostering inclusive dialogue. Gilles Dutertre and Sam Shoamanesh [advocate](/_arguendo/the-icc-and-cultural-property.md) for the designation of cultural destruction as an atrocity crime before the ICC.
