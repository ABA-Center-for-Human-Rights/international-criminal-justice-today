  States Parties, and our civil society colleagues in helping protect the independence
  of the Court from political interference and ensuring that the ICC receives all
  necessary resources to help maintain international peace and security through the
  fair and impartial application of international law. In our view, the fight to end
  impunity for atrocity crimes begins with support for the ICC.

**The Hague, The Netherlands, Dec. 7, 2018:** Before the 17th Session of the Assembly of States Parties (ASP) of the International Criminal Court (ICC), the American Bar Association (ABA) reaffirmed its support for the International Criminal Court and the Court’s mandate to investigate and prosecute (where warranted) those responsible for international atrocity crimes. The International Criminal Court has jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression.

Addressing the Assembly on behalf of the ABA, Past President of the ABA and Chair of the ABA’s ICC Project [Michael S. Greco](https://www.aba-icc.org/board-of-advisors/michael-s-greco/) recalled the ABA’s longstanding support for the ICC through [policy positions](https://www.aba-icc.org/the-aba-icc-project/aba-policy-on-the-icc/) advocating for the Court’s creation, and later for greater U.S. engagement and cooperation with the Court and its activities. He acknowledged the ICC’s centrality to international justice efforts and international peace and security, noting that “the fight to end impunity for atrocity crimes begins with support for the ICC.”

Greco also stressed the role of States and civil society in protecting the Court from political interference, and the necessity of adequate resources needed for the Court to continue its pursuit of international criminal justice.

> “It is in the context of the ABA’s longstanding and unwavering commitment to the ICC that we join others in urging the Assembly of States Parties and international civil society to redouble their commitment to the ICC as well. The Court is needed now more than ever.” - Michael S. Greco
