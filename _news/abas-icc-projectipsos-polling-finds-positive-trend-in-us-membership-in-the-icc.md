#### Additionally, majority of Americans believe international arrest warrants should trump diplomatic immunity

Washington, D.C., Nov. 25, 2015 – The [ABA’s ICC Project](http://www.aba-icc.org/) today released the results of its most recent poll done in partnership with [Ipsos Public Affairs](http://www.ipsos-na.com/research/public-affairs/), and it showed good news for US-ICC relations. After four waves of polling over two years, the data showed a positive trend in Americans' opinions on membership in the International Criminal Court (ICC), specifically a 5% increase in agreement with the statement, “US should become a full member of the International Criminal Court and robustly support all of its work”. Similarly, there was a 2% decrease in agreement with the statement, "joining the ICC would compromise America's sovereignty as a nation”. While these findings are *indicative only* and should be treated with caution, they do suggest the possibility of a slow shift in American attitudes on US membership in the ICC.

This most recent poll also asked Americans about South Africa's - an ICC State Party - refusal to arrest Sudan President and ICC fugitive, Omar al-Bashir while in country for an African Union conference. Wanted by the ICC for his alleged role in atrocities committed in Darfur, President Bashir's immunity while in country for a diplomatic conference was the justification given by South Africa for not arresting him. Despite this asserted immunity, a majority of Americans who expressed an opinion believed South Africa should have arrested President al-Bashir. When asked generally about this issue, more than 2 to 1 believed international arrest warrants should trump diplomatic immunity, however the ratio decreased significantly (38% to 32%) for those polled who had some awareness of the ICC.
