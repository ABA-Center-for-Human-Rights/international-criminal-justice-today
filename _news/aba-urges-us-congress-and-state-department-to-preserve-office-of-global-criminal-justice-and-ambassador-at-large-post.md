Washington, D.C. - At the 2017 American Bar Association (ABA) Annual Meeting held in New York City, the ABA House of Delegates unanimously passed a&nbsp;[policy resolution](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/abanews/2017%20Annual%20Resolutions/10D.pdf)&nbsp;urging the United States Congress and the Department of State to continue American commitment and support to ensuring criminal accountability for mass atrocities. This ABA policy position urged not only for the continuation of the US State Department's Office of Global Criminal Justice and its Ambassador at-large post, but an increase in support for its critically important assistance to global efforts to end impunity for the atrocity crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.

The ABA took this policy position in response to recent news that the Donald J. Trump Administration is currently exploring whether to reduce or eliminate this State Department office and Ambassador position, all without any alternative plans on how the US would continue to promote its interests and leadership in holding criminally accountable individuals who participate in mass atrocities around the world.

Emphasizing the importance of this resolution to show the support of the American legal community to international criminal justice, the policy resolution was introduced before the ABA House of Delegates by former ABA President and Chair of the [ABA's International Criminal Court Project](https://www.aba-icc.org/), [Michael S. Greco](https://www.aba-icc.org/board-of-advisors/michael-s-greco/). Speaking in support of the resolution was former US Ambassador at-large for War Crimes Issues, Stephen J. Rapp, and member of the ABA's ICC Project [Board of Advisors](https://www.aba-icc.org/the-aba-icc-project/board-of-advisors/), and former senior legal advisor to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), [Colonel James S. Durant III](https://seniorexecs.org/about/board-directors/898-james-m-durant-iii-esq-department-of-energy).

Acknowledging that "the promise of 'never again' has been hard to keep", Ambassador Rapp stated that this unfortunate reality does not diminish the importance of the rule of law to deterring atrocity crimes. Ambassador Rapp further emphasized that the State Department Office of Global Criminal Justice and its Ambassador at-large are integral to ensuring that international criminal tribunals are appropriately resourced, receives US cooperation with atrocity crimes investigations and prosecutions, and staffed by competent prosecutors, judges, and lawyers. He concluded by stating how important it is to the policy discussion in Washington, D.C. and to global efforts to investigate and prosecute atrocity crimes that the collective voice of American lawyers be heard.

Speaking after Ambassador Rapp was ABA Delegate Colonel Durant III who spoke intimately about how crucial the Office of Global Criminal Justice was to NATO missions to apprehend indicted atrocity criminals in the former Yugoslavia and transfer them to The Hague, The Netherlands. Noting the pride he and fellow servicemembers took in supporting international criminal justice, Colonel Durant made clear that the Ambassador at-large and Office of Global Criminal Justice was vital to the formation and implementation of strong US policy on atrocity crimes and, therefore,the office "of course" must continue.
