#### New findings highlight importance of international organizations that support human rights

Washington, D.C., Apr. 13, 2015 – Today, the ABA’s ICC Project released the results of a poll that it conducted jointly with Ipsos Public Affairs. Among other findings about the American public’s attitudes toward international criminal justice, the poll found that more Americans than not believe Palestinian membership in the International Criminal Court (ICC) has a long-term positive impact on the Israel-Palestine peace process. Of those polled who were aware of the ICC, 35% thought there was a positive long-term impact on the peace process. Furthermore, more Americans than not believe that Palestine’s membership at the ICC advances international justice. On overall perceptions of the ICC, nearly two-thirds of Americans agree on the importance of international organizations that support human rights and that hold individuals accountable for mass atrocities. In addition to these findings, the poll also found a small uptick in Americans’ support for the ICC and for its government supporting the ICC’s work.
