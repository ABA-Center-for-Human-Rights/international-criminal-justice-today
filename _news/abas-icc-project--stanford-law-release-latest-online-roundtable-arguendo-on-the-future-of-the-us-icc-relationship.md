#### **The ABA’s ICC Project & Stanford Law releases its most recent** Arguendo**, addressing the future of the US-ICC relationship.**

Washington D.C., June 20, 2014 – The [American Bar Association’s International Criminal Court (ICC) Project](http://www.aba-icc.org/) and [Stanford Law School Program in International and Comparative Law](https://law.stanford.edu/stanford-program-in-international-and-comparative-law/) are pleased to announce the release of the latest online expert roundtable, *[Arguendo](http://www.international-criminal-justice-today.org/arguendo/)*, on the next steps of the US-ICC relationship.

<br>To discuss this critical relationship in international criminal justice, a highly distinguished panel was assembled: Honorable Richard J. Goldstone, former chief prosecutor of the United Nations International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda; Professor Allen S. Weiner, Senior Lecturer in Law at Stanford Law School; Honorable David Scheffer, former U.S. Ambassador at-Large for War Crimes Issues; and Stephen Rademaker, government relations consultant in Washington DC.

In answering the question, “*What are the next steps in the US-ICC relationship?*”, each *Arguendo* contributor put forth their opinions on the future of the United States’ relationship with the ICC. In his article, Honorable Goldstone [calls for](https://www.international-criminal-justice-today.org/arguendo/only-two-decades-ago-there-was-no-international-criminal-justice/) the withdrawal of legislation prohibiting US funding of the ICC and an increased American presence in the ICC. Professor Weiner [argued](https://www.international-criminal-justice-today.org/arguendo/the-united-states-and-the-international-criminal-court-building-support-for-the-international-rule-of-law/) for the full commitment of the US to the ICC through the ratification of the Rome Statute, rather than offering support on a case-by-case basis. Ambassador Rapp [concurs](https://www.international-criminal-justice-today.org/arguendo/advancing-us-interests-in-its-evolving-relationship-with-the-international-criminal-court/) with Professor Weiner’s call for ratification, adding a call for domestic enactment of crimes against humanity legislation. Mr. Rademaker [highlights](https://www.international-criminal-justice-today.org/arguendo/the-pity-of-the-international-criminal-court-icc-is-that-it-could-have-been-a-useful-and-relevant-institution/) criticisms of the efficacy of the ICC as a justification for a continued absence of US involvement.
