#### Americans continue to support involvement with the International Criminal Court (ICC), with some opposition to the U.S. becoming a full member of the Court.

Washington, D.C., December 8, 2014 – The [ABA’s ICC Project](http://www.aba-icc.org/) today released the results of its most recent poll done in partnership with [Ipsos Public Affairs](http://www.ipsos-na.com/research/public-affairs/). Findings from this survey were largely consistent with those from the first survey in [February](https://www.international-criminal-justice-today.org/polling-data/2014/02/17/february-2014-ipsos-polling-data/). Knowledge of the ICC remains similarly low, with 64% of Americans indicating that they know “nothing at all” about the ICC. This lack of knowledge notwithstanding, nearly four in ten (37%) Americans support the United States becoming more involved with or a full member of the ICC, showing support for the objectives and work of the ICC.

The polling also surveyed American support for assisting the ICC in investigating alleged atrocity crimes committed as part of ISIS/The Islamic State. While at present, United States law prohibits the allocation of funds to the ICC, over half (55%) of Americans familiar with the ICC support amending the legislation to allow for funding of the ICC relating to investigations of ISIS/The Islamic State. Even when concerns that if the US was to assist the ICC, the Court may one day also target American citizens or citizens of our allies were highlighted, over half (55%) of those familiar with the ICC remained in favor of amending legislation. Among the general public, there was also only a slight downward shift, from 42% to 39%.
