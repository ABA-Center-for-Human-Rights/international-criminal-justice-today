**Washington, D.C., Friday, June 12, 2020 -**&nbsp;The American Bar Association expressed deep concern today over recently announced US policy authorizing sanctions on the International Criminal Court, its staff, and others.&nbsp;

On Thursday, June 11, 2020, Secretary of State Pompeo, joined by&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**&nbsp;[announced](https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2019/03/290394.htm)&nbsp;that the United States would restrict visas for “individuals directly responsible for any ICC investigation of U.S. personnel,” including “persons who take or have taken action to request or further such an investigation.” The administration also indicated that it may use visa restrictions “to deter ICC efforts to pursue allied personnel,” and that it may employ additional measures such as economic sanctions for those purposes in the future.&nbsp;**

In a statement, ABA President Judy Perry Martinez recalled the ABA’s&nbsp;[long support](https://www.aba-icc.org/the-aba-icc-project/aba-policy-on-the-icc/)&nbsp;for the Court and renewed the ABA's "longstanding call that the U.S. conduct and complete its own thorough investigation and prosecution of any atrocity crimes committed by U.S. officials and personnel and, in so doing, exercise U.S. sovereignty." The ICC is a court of last resort, and only has jurisdiction where states themselves are unwilling or unable to prosecute the crimes the ICC is investigating. The ICC is currently investigating atrocity crimes committed on the territory of Afghanistan, an ICC State Party, which include crimes allegedly by the Taliban as well as crimes allegedly committed by Afghan national forces and members of US armed forces and CIA personnel.&nbsp;

"As Secretary Pompeo has acknowledged," President Martinez noted, "the U.S. is able to conduct its own investigations of such actions which, if carried out, would effectively eliminate ICC jurisdiction. But to date the U.S. has not done so."
