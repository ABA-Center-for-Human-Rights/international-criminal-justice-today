**United Nations, New York, Dec. 2017:** The American Bar Association (ABA) emphasized the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) role as a “bulwark against impunity” for perpetrators of mass atrocities before the 16th Session of the Assembly of States Parties of the International Criminal Court in New York.

![](/uploads/aspstatement3.jpg)Delivered by ABA’s ICC Project Board Member [Christopher “Kip” Hale](https://www.aba-icc.org/board-of-advisors/christopher-kip-hale/), the ABA’s statement emphasized the need for States Parties’ continued commitment to the ICC through political, financial, procedural, and other support, and underscored States’ role in empowering the Court to fight against impunity for atrocity crimes.
