On September 2, 2020, the ICC Prosecutor and a senior staff member were [designated](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/blocking-property-of-certain-persons-associated-with-the-international-criminal-court-sanctions) by the US Office of Foreign Asset Control &nbsp;as "specially designated nationals." In response, ABA President Patricia Lee Refo issued a statement&nbsp;[again condemning](https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2020/09/presidential-statement-icc/)&nbsp;the use of punitive economic and travel sanctions against ICC personnel, urging nations to protect the ICC's independence and urging the US administration to reverse the decision immediately.

Noting the potentially "severe consequences not only for ICC officials and staff, but also for the diverse groups of victims and legal professionals who contribute to the courtâ€™s work," President Refo said that "sanctioning legal professionals for their investigating and prosecuting allegations of atrocity crimes on behalf of an independent judicial institution is an act of intimidation and attack on the rule of law."

President Refo's statement follows statements by previous ABA Presidents Bob Carlson and Judy Perry Martinez urging the United States to reverse previously imposed [visa restrictions](https://www.international-criminal-justice-today.org/news/statement-of-aba-president-bob-carlson-re-restricting-international-criminal-court-officials-visas/)&nbsp;on ICC personnel and [Executive Order 13928](https://www.international-criminal-justice-today.org/news/statement-of-aba-president-judy-perry-martinez-re-u-s--sanctions-of-international-criminal-court-personnel/)&nbsp;(which authorized the sanctions imposed on September 2) respectively.&nbsp;
