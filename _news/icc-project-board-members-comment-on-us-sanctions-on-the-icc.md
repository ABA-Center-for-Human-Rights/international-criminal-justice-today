  "[T]he existence of tribunals to help enforce international law is an asset to
  U.S. security. Americans should continue to protect U.S. service members with
  a firm commitment to international law. And when Americans’ actions are
  scrutinized, the U.S. government should have the confidence to react in a way
  that preserves the benefits of these institutions, protects U.S. personnel,
  and does justice to American values."

**Washington, DC -&nbsp;**In response to the United States' June 11, 2020 "[E](__notset__)[xecutive Order](Executive Order on Blocking Property Of Certain Persons Associated With The International Criminal Court)&nbsp;on Blocking Property Of Certain Persons Associated With The International Criminal Court" and previous policy statements attacking the independence of the International Criminal Court, many members of the ICC Project's [Board of Advisors](https://www.aba-icc.org/the-aba-icc-project/board-of-advisors/)wrote analyses, made recommendations, and shared their perspectives on the executive order and its potential impact on the ICC, its staff, and other individuals or organizations who support the Court's work (including US citizens and organizations). Their varied articles reflect research, expertise and previous work in academia, government, the military, and international criminal tribunals. Comments highlight the policies' impact on the historical leadership role the United States has played in supporting justice and accountability for atrocity crimes.

In addition to the individual views and open letter listed below, groups of [ICC S](__notset__)[tates Parties](https://onu.delegfrance.org/We-remain-committed-to-an-international-rules-based-order), [civil society organizations](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/06/11/oppose-trump-administration-measures-against-international-criminal-court), and [bar](https://www.nycbar.org/member-and-career-services/committees/reports-listing/reports/detail/executive-order-authorizing-international-criminal-court-icc-sanctions)&nbsp;[associations](https://www.ibanet.org/Article/NewDetail.aspx?ArticleUid=91b435ac-2ab3-4dad-b8b2-2f6c18d8aecd)&nbsp;(including the [American Bar Association](https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2020/06/aba-president-judy-perry-martinez-statement-re--u-s--sanctions-o/)) have also issued public statements expressing concern or opposition to the executive order, including its attempt to sanction legal professionals for doing their jobs as part of an independent judicial institution.

<u><strong>Statement of Lawyers and Legal Scholars Against U.S. Sanctions on ICC Investigators of Atrocities</strong></u>

Many ICC Project board members also contributed to and chose to sign (in their personal capacities) an open letter from scholars, lawyers, diplomats, civil servants and national security professionals urging President Trump to rescind [Executive Order 13928](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-blocking-property-certain-persons-associated-international-criminal-court/). Signatories wrote that they "share the conviction that sanctioning ICC lawyers for carrying out their responsibilities to investigate atrocities is wrong in principle, contrary to American values, and prejudicial to U.S. national security." Acknowledging a diversity of views on the ICC and the investigation of the situation in Afghanistan, the letter said that "sanctioning ICC lawyers is also contrary to our longstanding national commitment to human rights, the rule of law, and accountability for those who commit atrocities," noting that these actions undermine the legitimacy of sanctions used in other contexts, and impact US credibility in its support for accountability in other atrocity situations. The letter was posted both in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/lawyers-urge-trump-to-rescind-sanctions-and-travel-bans-for-international-criminal-court/2020/06/29/0ef0c476-ba15-11ea-86d5-3b9b3863273b_story.html) and [Opinio Juris](http://opiniojuris.org/2020/06/30/statement-against-us-sanctions-on-icc-investigations/).
