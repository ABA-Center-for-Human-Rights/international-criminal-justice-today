<u><strong>Statement of Lawyers and Legal Scholars Against U.S. Sanctions on ICC Investigators of Atrocities</strong></u>

Many ICC Project board members also chose to sign an open letter from scholars, lawyers, diplomats, civil servants and national security professionals urging urging President Trump to rescind [Executive Order 13928](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-blocking-property-certain-persons-associated-international-criminal-court/), writing that it "share the conviction that sanctioning ICC lawyers for carrying out their responsibilities to investigate atrocities is wrong in principle, contrary to American values, and prejudicial to U.S. national security." Noting the signatories had a diversity of views on the ICC and the investigation of the situation in Afghanistan, the letter said that "sanctioning ICC lawyers is also contrary to our longstanding national commitment to human rights, the rule of law, and accountability for those who commit atrocities," noting that these actions undermines the legitimacy of sanctions used in other contexts, and impacts US credibility on its support for accountability in other atrocity situations. The letter was posted both in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/lawyers-urge-trump-to-rescind-sanctions-and-travel-bans-for-international-criminal-court/2020/06/29/0ef0c476-ba15-11ea-86d5-3b9b3863273b_story.html) and [Opinio Juris](http://opiniojuris.org/2020/06/30/statement-against-us-sanctions-on-icc-investigations/).
