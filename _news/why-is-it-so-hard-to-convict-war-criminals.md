#### Huffington Post Live hosts interview of experts in international criminal justice.

Washington D.C., June 20, 2013 - Huffington Post Live hosted an interview of experts in the field of international criminal justice. The panel addressed the difficulties faced by the International Criminal Court (ICC) and other international criminal justice endeavors in obtaining convictions of alleged atrocity criminals. The trouble with witnesses protection and available resources to the Court was stressed by panel members, along with the difficulty the Prosecutor faces in obtaining evidence in on-going conflicts or post-conflict situations. Nonetheless, each expert ultimately remained optimistic that the Court, while young, was on the right track.
