The American Bar Association (ABA) Center for Human Rights is pleased to announce that Ambassador Stephen J. Rapp, former U.S. Ambassador at-large for War Crimes Issues in the State Department’s Office of Global Criminal Justice, has joined the [Board of Advisors](http://www.aba-icc.org/the-aba-icc-project/board-of-advisors/) of ABA’s International Criminal Court Project.

[Ambassador Rapp](http://www.aba-icc.org/board-of-advisors/hon-stephen-j-rapp/) is a preeminent leader and expert in the field of international criminal justice in the United States and internationally. He has served as chief or senior prosecutor at two international criminal tribunals and has served as the United States’ lead diplomat in the global effort to hold accountable those who perpetrate mass atrocity crimes. Former ABA President [Michael S. Greco](http://www.aba-icc.org/board-of-advisors/michael-s-greco/), Chair of the ABA Center for Human Rights, welcomed Ambassador Rapp to the Board and said, “We are delighted to welcome Ambassador Rapp to the Project’s Board of Advisors. He brings vast international criminal law expertise, insight, leadership and sound judgment that will enhance our distinguished international Board of Advisors and its important guiding role for the Project.”

Prior to serving as U.S. Ambassador at-large for War Crimes Issues, Ambassador Rapp was Chief Prosecutor of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, a role that resulted in unprecedented global advancements in the jurisprudence of international atrocity law and the successful prosecution of Liberian President Charles Taylor. Prior to the Sierra Leone Court, he served as Senior Trial Attorney and Chief of Prosecutions at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, where he helped secure the first conviction in history against leaders of the mass media for the crime of direct and public incitement to commit genocide. Earlier in his distinguished career Ambassador Rapp served in the Iowa House of Representatives, and was staff director and counsel for the U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency and U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Iowa. He received his B.A. Degree from Harvard College and J.D. from Drake Law School.
