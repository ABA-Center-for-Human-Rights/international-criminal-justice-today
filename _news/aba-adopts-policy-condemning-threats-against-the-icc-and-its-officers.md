At the 2020 American Bar Association (ABA) Annual Meeting, held virtually, the ABA House of Delegates adopted policy "urg\[ing\] all national governments to observe, respect, and protect the independence of the International Criminal Court;" and "condemn\[ing\] threats by governments to the International Criminal Court and its officers and personnel in the performance of their duties."

The policy adopted follows previous statements by ABA Past Presidents [Bob Carlson](https://www.international-criminal-justice-today.org/news/statement-of-aba-president-bob-carlson-re-restricting-international-criminal-court-officials-visas/) and [Judy Perry Martinez](https://www.international-criminal-justice-today.org/news/statement-of-aba-president-judy-perry-martinez-re-u-s--sanctions-of-international-criminal-court-personnel/) urging the US government to rescind and refrain from further [sanctions](https://www.international-criminal-justice-today.org/news/icc-project-board-members-comment-on-us-sanctions-on-the-icc/) against legal professionals working at the International Criminal Court. The ABA has a [long history](https://www.aba-icc.org/the-aba-icc-project/aba-policy-on-the-icc/)of policy support for the International Criminal Court&nbsp; as a crucial venue for accountability for atrocity crimes, and has in the past encouraged the United States to engage cooperatively with the Court's investigations and proceedings.&nbsp;
