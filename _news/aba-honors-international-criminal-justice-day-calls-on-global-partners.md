#### ABA President Hubbard calls on global partners to increase support of domestic and international atrocity accountability efforts.

Washington D.C., July 16, 2015 — In a [statement to commemorate July 17 as International Criminal Justice Day](http://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2015/07/aba_honors_internati.html), American Bar Association President [William C. Hubbard](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/leadership/aba_officers/hubbard.html) acknowledged the global efforts, led by the [International Criminal Court](https://www.icc-cpi.int/)&nbsp;(ICC) and the international community, to combat genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.

In the statement, Hubbard called on global partners to increase support of domestic and international atrocity accountability efforts, particularly those of the ICC, and highlighted the ABA’s contributions, particularly the&nbsp;[ABA's International Criminal Court Project](https://www.aba-icc.org/), to the advancement of the rule of law and the achievement of international criminal justice.

Last year, to coincide with International Criminal Justice Day, the ABA's ICC Project launched a comprehensive [website](http://www.aba-icc.org/) to provide information and resources for government officials, diplomats and reporters who shape international affairs policy and news on international crimes and conflicts.

The website features “[International Criminal Justice Today](http://www.international-criminal-justice-today.org/),” an online periodical that offers news on current events in the field and provides regular polling data from [Ipsos market research](http://www.international-criminal-justice-today.org/ipsos-polling-data/) on American opinions on the ICC. The site also features “*Arguendo,*” a virtual roundtable forum where distinguished experts from different fields discuss and debate pressing international criminal justice issues.
