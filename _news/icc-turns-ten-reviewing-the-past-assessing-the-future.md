Stanford, California, May 11, 2012 – On May 11, 2012, experts gathered at Stanford University Law School for the first conference to be held in the United States commemorating the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) first ten years of operations. Over several panels, various experts discussed the progress achieved and present obstacles facing the ICC at ten years old. Although many experts agreed that the ICC has overcome many challenges there still remains a great deal of work to be done. Mr. Michael Greco, former ABA President and chair of the ABA ICC Project, stated, “The ICC Project of the ABA will say to those in the United States who may fear or doubt the ICC, that the American legal profession believes in the ICC, that the imminent bipartisan members of the ICC Project Board of Advisers believe in the ICC, that support for the ICC not only serves the interest of the United States but safeguards the values that we as a civilized people have longed cherished, that we are comfortable with the Court and its important role in the world, that everyone in America should be comfortable with the Court.”
