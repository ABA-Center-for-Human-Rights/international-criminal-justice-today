Washington, D.C., July 17, 2017 - Released on [International Criminal Justice Day](https://www.facebook.com/InternationalCriminalCourt), the latest ABA's ICC Project/Ipsos [polling data](https://www.international-criminal-justice-today.org/ipsos-polling-data/) finds a continual trend upwards in Americans knowing about the International Criminal Court (ICC) and believing that the US should support the ICC. 47% of Americans know at least "a little bit" about the ICC with 60% of millennials having "a little bit" of knowledge about the Court. The 47% number is two points higher (45%) than the previous high in awareness levels found in the July 2016 poll. This poll also showed another high with 50% of all Americans believing the US government should get more involved or fully join the ICC. Of those with some awareness of the ICC, 48% believe the US should join the ICC.

For this poll, questions were asked of Americans and their opinions on the most effective way to fight terrorism, namely through military means and/or criminal prosecutions. 52% of all Americans believe using both military force and legal cases is the most effective way of combating terrorism with 20% saying just military force and 12% saying just legal cases. For those with awareness of the ICC, 53% percent believe the combination of both tools is most effective.
