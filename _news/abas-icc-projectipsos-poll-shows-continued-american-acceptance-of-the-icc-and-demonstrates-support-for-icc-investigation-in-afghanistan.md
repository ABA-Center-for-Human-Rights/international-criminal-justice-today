Washington, D.C., June 12, 2018 - The results of the latest ABA’s ICC Project/Ipsos polling report make clear that more and more American know about and support the ICC. In almost all categories of questions, Americans showed equal or more awareness of the ICC and support for the Court's work in comparison to past polls. Specifically, there was a five percent uptick in the awareness of all Americans of the ICC (from 40% to 45% since the July 2017 [poll](https://www.international-criminal-justice-today.org/polling-data/2017/07/17/july-2017-ipsos-polling-results/){: target="_blank"}).&nbsp;

Likewise, 50% of Americans believe the US should join the ICC or get more involved in the Court, a mark that stayed the same from the July 2017 poll. This number coincides with the slight increase in Americans (63%) that believe the US should dedicate resources, including financial, military and intelligence, to international organizations like the ICC that support human rights and that hold individuals accountable for mass atrocities. Only 20% believe the US should not join the Court.&nbsp;

For this poll, Americans were asked of the ICC's potential investigation in Afghanistan of alleged crimes committed by US military and intelligence personnel as well as members of the Taliban or Islamic States. Surprisingly, more Americans (68%) were not only supportive of an investigation of militant extremist groups like the Taliban, but were also more supportive (45%) than not (21%) of an investigation that targeted Americans. The overall support for an ICC investigation in Afghanistan either did not change (50%) or was more favorable (31%) once explained that the investigation could include members from all of these parties.&nbsp;
