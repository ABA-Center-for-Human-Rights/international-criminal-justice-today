On June 2, 2014, the American Bar Association (ABA) Center for Human Rights and its International Criminal Court Project hosted the Registrar of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Mr. Herman von Hebel, for a discussion on practical challenges facing the ICC. Moderated by Kip Hale, Director of the ABA-ICC Project, the conversation covered many important issues relevant to the ICC and the Registry, including victim reparations, defense counsel issues, and witness protection. 
On this issue Mr. Von Hebel stressed the need for better witness protection programs, stating that “[i]f witnesses don’t have the guarantee that any protection that might be required will be provided, they won’t speak up and we won’t be able to run our trials. I don’t think I can explain more importantly how crucial witness protection is, and I think it is now one of the biggest challenges the court faces”. On the topic of ICC outreach and how best to implement it, Mr. Hale emphasized that “[c]oordinating between the Court, states, and civil society to pursue those efforts and echo them is definitely needed.”
