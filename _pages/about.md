*International Criminal Justice Today* (ICJT) is an online periodical devoted to news, opinion, and other current events on international criminal justice, or the fight to hold criminally accountable those who participate in the international atrocity crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and aggression. ICJT is the product of a partnership between the [American Bar Association Center for Human Rights](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/human_rights.html), its [ABA International Criminal Court Project](www.aba-icc.org) and [Stanford Law School Program in International and Comparative Law](https://www.law.stanford.edu/areas-of-interest/international-and-comparative-law)

ICJT includes many exciting features that we hope you enjoy. *Arguendo* is a regular roundtable debate where experts from varied fields give their opinion on a question presented, such as "what is the next ten years of international criminal justice going to look like?" In partnership with the market research firm [Ipsos](http://www.ipsos-na.com/), ICJT includes quarterly polling reports on Americans' opinions on international criminal justice, specifically the International Criminal Court. ICJT also includes its *Opinion* section, regular blogpost about international criminal justice by ICJT's featured contributors. There is also events recapts of ABA International Criminal Court events and *Headlines*, an aggregation of online news articles on international criminal justice.
