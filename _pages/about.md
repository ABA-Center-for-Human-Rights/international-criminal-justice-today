*International Criminal Justice Today* (ICJT) is an online periodical dedicated to providing news, opinion, and other current events on international criminal justice, or the fight to hold criminally accountable those who participate in the international atrocity crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and aggression. ICJT is the product of a partnership between the [American Bar Association Center for Human Rights](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/human_rights.html), its [ABA International Criminal Court Project] (www.aba-icc.org) and [Stanford Law School Program in International and Comparative Law](https://www.law.stanford.edu/areas-of-interest/international-and-comparative-law)

ICJT has many exciting features that we hope you enjoy and find informative. *Arguendo*, or "for the sake of argument" in Latin, is a regular roundtable debate where experts from varied fields give their opinion on a current issue in international criminal justice. In partnership with the market research firm [Ipsos](http://www.ipsos-na.com/), ICJT includes quarterly polling reports on Americans' opinions on international criminal justice, specifically the International Criminal Court. ICJT also includes its *Opinion* section, which features regular blogp0st by ICJT contributors. There is also information about past and future events of the ABA International Criminal Court, and *Headlines*, an aggregation of news articles on international criminal justice.
