excerpt: "For Americans with some knowledge of the International Criminal Court, desire to see more US support, but unsure if U.S. should join the Court just yet."
---

The [American Bar Association's International Criminal Court (ICC) Project](http://www.aba-icc.org) has partnered with [Ipsos Market Research](http://www.ipsos-na.com/) to provide regular polling data on American opinions on international criminal justice, in particular the ICC. Through quarterly reports, Ipsos will track a range of issues on whether and to what extent Americans feel the U.S. Government should support the ICC, including joining the Court. Additionally, each report will feature American opinions on a current event in international criminal justice.
