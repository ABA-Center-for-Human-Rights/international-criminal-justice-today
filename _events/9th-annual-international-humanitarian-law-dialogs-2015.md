From August 31st to September 1, 2015, international prosecutors and legal scholars from around the globe gathered for the 9th Annual International Humanitarian Law Dialogs in Chautauqua, New York. This year’s conference was titled _“The Wrongs We Seek”_ in commemoration of the anniversary of the Srebrenica Massacre in Bosnia (1995) and the opening of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg (1945).

Hosted by the Robert H. Jackson Center in Jamestown, New York, the Dialogs are one of the few annual gatherings of the leading prosecutors from the various international criminal tribunals, including the International Criminal Court, International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, Special Court for Sierra Leone, Special Tribunal for Lebanon, and Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia. The Dialogs also host leading professionals in the field of international criminal and humanitarian law. As in year's past, the Dialogs featured prominent keynote speakers, panel discussions, updates of each tribunal from the prosecutors, and breakout “porch sessions” on selected topics. The American Bar Association proudly sponsors the Dialogs along with other distinguished organizations.

Other highlights was the presentation of the _Joshua Heintz Award for Humanitarian Achievement._ Given annually, the award recognizes an individual who demonstrates compassion, vision, and dedication in pursuit of international humanitarian justice. This year’s award honored Sergei Magnitsky who was an accountant and tax partner at the Moscow law firm Firestone Duncan. Magnitsky was arrested in November 2008 after he helped Hermitage Capital, once Russia’s largest foreign portfolio investor, reveal the biggest alleged tax fraud in the country’s history. He died while incarcerated in Russia.
