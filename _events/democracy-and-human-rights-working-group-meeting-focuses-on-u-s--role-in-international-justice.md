**Washington, D.C., Nov. 14, 2018:** Along with Arizona State University's&nbsp;[McCain Institute for International Leadership](https://www.mccaininstitute.org/), the ABA’s ICC Project and Criminal Justice Section co-convened a meeting of the McCain Institute’s nonpartisan [Democracy and Human Rights Working Group](https://www.mccaininstitute.org/human-rights-democracy-mission/) in Washington, D.C. The November 2018 meeting of the Working Group focused on current challenges facing the International Criminal Court and international justice, including the United States’ relationship with the Court. Former Ambassadors and Deputy Ambassadors for Global Criminal Justice during various U.S. administrations opened the dialogue with a discussion of how the U.S. relationship with the ICC has evolved over the past two decades. ABA’s ICC Project Chair and Past ABA President [Michael S. Greco](https://www.aba-icc.org/board-of-advisors/michael-s-greco/) also offered remarks on the legal profession’s role in supporting international justice, as well as the importance of broadening the community of those involved with international justice issues in the United States.

Civil society practitioners, think tank and other experts, academics and current and former U.S. government officials attended the discussion, which included a question and answer session. &nbsp;
