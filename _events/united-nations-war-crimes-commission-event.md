On August 7, 2013, American Univeristy Washington College of Law hosted a panel of experts to discuss the utility, history, and impact of the United Nations War Crimes Commission (1943-48). The panelists discussed the exclusion of the public from the Commission’s archives, and the potential utility of publicizing the archives. Mr. Kip Hale, Director of the American Bar Association’s (ABA) International Criminal Court (ICC) Project who has previously litigated at international criminal tribunals, explained that the the archives would be useful in providing guidance for present and future international criminal trials. Kip stated that guidance would be helpful, and potentially necessary, because “we are never going to get rid of atrocities its just about how we deal with them in the aftermath.” Click the link below to hear the full discussion.

War Crimes Commission Archives shifts a paradigm from where we always talk about Nuremberg and tells us there&rsquo;s actually more information out there, and we can say which are the legal concepts that were criminal at that time, or these are the perpetrators that we can hold accountable.&rdquo; &mdash; Mr. Kip Hale</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re never going to get rid of atrocities, its just about how to deal with them in the aftermath.&rdquo; &mdash; Mr. Kip Hale</p></figure>
