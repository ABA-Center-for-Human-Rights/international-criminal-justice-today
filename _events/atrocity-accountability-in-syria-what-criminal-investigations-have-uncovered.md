Washington, D.C., Apr. 14, 2015 - The American Bar Association (ABA) Center for Human Rights and its International Criminal Court Project hosted a closed door meeting of experts on Syria entitled “Atrocity Accountability in Syria: What Criminal Investigations Have Uncovered.” The event discussed the legal implications of a non-governmental organization undertaking high-level criminal investigation of international atrocity crimes in Syria and whether Syria policymakers should utilize this information in addressing this 4 year old conflict. The experts in attendance came from the US government, international diplomatic corps, policy think tanks, human rights and rule of law organizations, and other members of civil society.
