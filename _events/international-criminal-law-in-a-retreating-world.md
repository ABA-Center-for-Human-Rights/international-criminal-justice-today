On April 13, the American Bar Association's (ABA) International Criminal Court Project and sponsoring partners held a distinguished two panel event entitled "*International Criminal Law in a Retreating World*", graciously hosted at Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough law firm overlooking the US Capitol. This event was [organized](http://bit.ly/2ogTQPT) to address the current state and future of international criminal justice, as well as to discuss what should be US policy on the [International Criminal Court](https://www.icc-cpi.int/) (ICC) and the field in general when considering the apparent retreat of the world from international law and cooperation.&nbsp;

Moderated by **Ms. Sara Dill** of the ABA Criminal Justice Section, the first panel featured **Mrs. Janet Benshoof**, president and founder of the Global Justice Center and founder of the Center for Reproductive Rights, **Mr. John Bellinger III**, former legal adviser of the US Department of State, adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and a partner at Arnold & Porter law firm in Washington, D.C., and **Mr. Stephen Lamony**, senior advocate for Africa at Amnesty International.

The conversation included a discussion of the expected deterioration of the US-ICC relationship under the current administration. Ms. Benshoof called for zealous advocacy in favor of continuing the Bush and Obama administrations' trend toward stronger and more open relations with the ICC. For his part, Mr. Bellinger stressed that there are significant shared interests between the US and ICC that should be widely discussed among stakeholders and interested parties. Mr. Bellinger also emphasized the need to educate the current administration on prior missteps in US policy on the ICC, such as those done during the early days of the Bush administration which he served.

The second panel was was moderated by former president of the ABA and current chair of the ABA's ICC Project, **Mr. Michael S. Greco**, and featured **Madame Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda**, the Prosecutor of the ICC and first female to hold this position, and **Ambassador David Scheffer**, the first US Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes issues who currently serves UN Secretary-General's Special Expert to the UN Assistance to the Khmer Rouge Trials and as Mayer Brown/Robert A. Helman Professor of Law & Director of the Center for International Human Rights at Northwestern University School of Law.

This conversation included a wide-ranging discussion of the challenges faced by Madame Prosecutor in the beginning part of her term, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor's achievements to date, and the future trajectory of the ICC as a whole. She elaborated on policy changes she has implemented as well as strategic developments in the ICC under her leadership, including a strong focus on sexual and gender-based crimes and the protection of cultural and religious property.

Amb. Scheffer presented his perspective on the state of international criminal justice, explaining that international tribunals cannot and should not be expected to function as a deterrent to violence, but as an instrument of justice. Deterrence, he argued, is a complicated matter that is primarily a geopolitical issue. The panelists also discussed the importance of state cooperation with international criminal tribunals, the provisional withdrawals of states from the ICC due to an apparent “Africa focus”, the various mechanisms of international criminal justice, and the future of US policy towards the Court.
