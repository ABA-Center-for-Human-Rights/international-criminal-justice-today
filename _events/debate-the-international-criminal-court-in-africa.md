On February 25, 2014, American University (AU) Council for Africa Studies at AU’s School of International Service hosted a panel debate on Africa and the ICC with a special focus on recent ICC cases against senior Kenyan governmental officials. The debaters were Prof. David Bosco of American University and author of [“*Rough Justice*”](http://www.american.edu/sis/events/Bosco-Book-Launch.cfm); Mr. Stephen Lamony, senior advisor to the Coalition for the International Criminal Court (ICC); and Ms. Regina Njogu, private Kenya attorney with experience in human rights issues.

The moderator of this debate was Mr. Michael Greco, former President of the American Bar Association (ABA) and chair of the ABA International Criminal Court Project. Mr. Greco began by explaining the ABA’s long-standing support of the ICC, stating, “[t[he ABA has long been a strong supporter of international criminal justice. Going back to the 1970’s the first policy adopted by the ABA regarding international criminal justice was to endorse the idea of a permanent tribunal for international justice.” During the debate, Ms. Njogu’s statements were critical of the ICC, alleging ICC incompetence in bringing justice to Africa, specifically in the case of Kenya. However, these allegations were firmly rejected by the other panelists who believed the Kenya government and other factors contributed to shortcomings in the Kenya cases at the ICC.

<figure data-type="quote">&gt; &ldquo;_What needs to be understood is, unlike national jurisdictions which have power of the police to do these things, the ICC works on cooperation. When the cases are falling apart because of lack of cooperation from the States, you hear about &lsquo;incompetence,&rsquo; but the reality is that there is simply no police force to accomplish these tasks._&rdquo; &mdash; Mr. Kip Hale</figure>

<figure data-type="quote">&gt; &ldquo;_The Kenyan government has given &lsquo;no cooperation whatsoever&rsquo; in the ICC investigation and has &lsquo;created a climate of fear&rsquo; in those in Kenya who attempt to._&rdquo; &mdash; Mr. Michael Greco</figure>
