This event featured a discussion between Mark Lattimer, Director of the Ceasefire Center for Civilian Rights; Mohammad Al Abdallah, Executive Director of the Syria Justice and Accountability Center (SJAC); and Jennifer Trahan, Associate Clinical Professor at New York University’s Center for Global Affairs that was moderated by Judge Patricia Wald, the former Chief Judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and a former judge at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.

The discussion focused on a report recently issued jointly by the Ceasefire Center and SJAC that discusses the feasibility and potential impacts of accountability options for crimes committed in Syria. The report focuses on the perspective of Syrian civilians and analyzes the potential ethical and practical challenges of accountability options including international, hybrid, and foreign domestic tribunals. The discussion also covered lessons learned from previous tribunals handling war crimes issues and how those lessons may be applied to the current situation in Syria. To view the full report, go to SJAC’s [Transitional Justice Library](http://syriaaccountability.org/library/a-step-towards-justice-2/).
