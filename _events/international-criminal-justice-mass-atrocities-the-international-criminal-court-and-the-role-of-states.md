During the panel discussion some of the issues addressed by Prosecutor Bensouda were the politicization of the ICC, its lack of adequate resources, and the misconceptions of the Court’s operations which are undermining the ICC and its important casework: “Misconceptions are another challenge that the court is facing. I think one of the biggest enemies of the Court - if I may put it that way - are the misconceptions or misperceptions of deliberately making sure that the Court is not understood. We need cooperation from States to make sure that the limitations of the Court are understood.”

One subject addressed by Justice Goldstone was the evolution of the U.S.-ICC relationship: “I can’t exaggerate the importance that the U.S. has played in the field of international criminal justice. I would go so far as to say that without the United States, we would not have a field of international criminal justice at all.”
