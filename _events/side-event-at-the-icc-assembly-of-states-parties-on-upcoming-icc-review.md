  Having experienced first-hand the delivery of justice or lack thereof to
  victims and affected communities, civil society actors, including those from
  ICC situation countries, are uniquely placed to consider how the Court can be
  strengthened and improved to better deliver justice to those most directly
  impacted by atrocity crimes. This side event will provide a forum for civil
  society organizations to highlight their concerns, priorities, and
  recommendations for how an ICC-wide review process led by independent experts
  might best address these challenges.

**The Hague, Netherlands, Dec. 2, 2019 -&nbsp;**Together with the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and Human Rights Watch, the ICC Project (ABA's Criminal Justice Section and Center for Human Rights) cosponsored a side event at the [18th Assembly of States Parties](https://asp.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/asp/sessions/documentation/18th%20session/Pages/default.aspx) of the International Criminal Court. Mindful of the court-wide review process (which was [authorized](https://asp.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/asp/sessions/documentation/18th%20session/Pages/Review.aspx) by States Parties later in the week), the side event, titled **"A Civil Society Conversation on ICC Review: Towards a Victim-Centered Assessment of ICC Performance,"** brought together a diverse group of experts and advocates to highlight the unique perspectives that victims, affected communities, and civil society organizations can contribute to an ICC review process.

In addition to remarks and reflections from civil society leaders from ICC situation countries, ICC Project Chair Michael Greco gave opening remarks, and board member Amb. Stephen Rapp discussed the essential role that civil society organizations have played in evidence-gathering and successful international criminal prosecutions.

In the discussion portion of the event, many civil society representatives discussed their concerns, expectations, and initial recommendations for topics the review process might cover, providing an important initial platform to build successive conversations in other events throughout the week.&nbsp;
