On December 11, 2014, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and the American Bar Association’s International Criminal Court Project co-sponsored an event entitled “_Prosecuting Sexual and Gender-Based Violence: New Directions in International Criminal Justice_” hosted at the CFR in New York City. This event featured a discussion between Madame Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Fatou Bensouda (The Gambia) and Ambassador David Scheffer, UN Secretary-General’s Special Expert on UN Assistance to the Khmer Rouge Trials, and former US Ambassador at-large for War Crimes Issues.

The well-attended evening event focused on the ICC Office of the Prosecutor’s (OTP) new [policy on Sexual and Gender Based Crimes](http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP-Policy-Paper-on-Sexual-and-Gender-Based-Crimes--June-2014.pdf), which is a comprehensive internal policy constructed through extensive external consultations. The purpose of this policy is to inform and guide the OTP’s entire operations in order to make them better attuned to sexual and gender based crime and related issues. The discussion also covered other important subject matters facing the ICC and the field of international criminal justice, such as recent atrocities committed in Syria and Iraq, developments in Democractic Republic of Congo and Kenya cases at the ICC, and the recently released US Senate report on torture.
