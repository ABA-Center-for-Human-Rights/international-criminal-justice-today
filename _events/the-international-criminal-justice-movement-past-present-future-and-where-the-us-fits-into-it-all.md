On February 20, 2014, the University of Denver Sturm College of Law (DU Law) welcomed Mr. Kip Hale, Senior Counsel at the American Bar Association (ABA) Center for Human Rights and Director of the ABA International Criminal Court (ICC) Project, to give a talk at an event sponsored by DU Law’s International Law Society and Ved Nanda Center for International and Comparative Law. In his talk on international criminal justice and the US role in the field, Mr. Hale explained the undesirable consequences caused by the United States and other states not fully engaging with the ICC. He additionally detailed the adverse and often unintended effects of obsolete anti-ICC legislations passed by U.S. Congress in the early 2000’s. In discussing the ICC’s first twelve years of operations, Mr. Hale stated, “a prevalent issue that has come out of the international criminal court system is international cooperation and assistance. The Court does not have police forces to do these things; cooperation is essential.” He concluded by stating there was reason to be positive about the future of U.S.-ICC relations. Despite past and current difficulties, U.S.-ICC relations are “not broken, but it needs to be worked on.” Video of the event can be found [here](http://du-denverlaw.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d2b0a003-647c-49f4-a270-340bacb39fb7) and below.

<figure data-type="quote"><p>&ldquo;There are two main issues as I see it right now, the first is complementarity; this issue is incredibly important for the international community to figure out. The second is the relationship between the ICC and the states; it is not broken but it needs to be worked on.&rdquo; &mdash; Mr. Kip Hale</p></figure>
