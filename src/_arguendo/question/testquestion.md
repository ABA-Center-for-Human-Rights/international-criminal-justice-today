Test. Building off positive developments at the end of the Bush administration, the Obama administration has transformed the US-ICC relationship from one of hostility to one of progress. While US policy supports ICC activities in all of its current situation countries - from Darfur to Uganda - US law still impedes assistance with the ICC institutionally and robust cooperation with its cases of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. What should the US do next in this relationship, if anything, and why? Also, should the ICC do something from its side of the relationship?
