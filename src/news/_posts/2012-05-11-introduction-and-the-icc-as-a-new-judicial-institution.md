On May 11, 2012, experts from across the globe gathered at Stanford University Law School for the first conference to be held in the United States commemorating the ICC's first ten years of operations. Over several panels, various experts discussed the progress achieved and present obstacles facing the ICC at ten years old. Although many experts agreed that the ICC has overcome many challenges there still remains a great deal of work to be done. Former Nuremberg Prosecutor Ben Ferencz concluded his remarks by saying, “[w]hat you’ve got to do now is work on improving the Court. It will come along. It is a prototype with all of the difficulties.” One such group in the United States working to support the ICC is the American Bar Association. Introducing the ABA's recently founded effort that works closely with international organizational partners, former ABA President and chair of the ABA-ICC Project, Michael Greco, stated, “The International Criminal Court Project of the ABA will say to those in the United States who may fear or doubt the ICC, that the American legal profession believes in the ICC, that the imminent bipartisan members of the ICC Project Board of Advisers believe in the ICC, that support for the ICC not only serves the interest of the United States but safeguards the values that we as a civilized people have longed cherished, that we are comfortable with the Court and its important role in the world, that everyone in America should be comfortable with the Court.” The full conference can be viewed below


> “War is a terrible thing. It is not something that is glorious. It is not the path to power. It is not the path to privilege or conquest or being a great thing. It is awful. That point of view is not something that is unique to me, because I can quote General Eisenhower who, when he was President of the United States said that, ‘the time has come for us to recognize that we have to give up force and rely only on the rule of law.”  
— Ben Ferencz

> “What you’ve got to do now is work on improving the Court. It will come along. It is a prototype, with all the difficulties. When the Wright Brothers were peddling and they thought they couldn’t make it fly, well, we all flew in here today.”  
— Ben Ferencz

> “We have obligations under international humanitarian law, to investigate these kinds of activities, not to engage in unlawful killings of civilians, not to engage in indiscriminate attacks,and to investigate them when they occur. If our forces are violating these rules, in my view, the US is best served by carrying out genuine investigations of them.”  
— Alan Wiener                                                                                                                                                                  

> “The words, indeed the imperative of ‘never again’ must not merely be set to paper and left to politics, but must be institutionalized under a just rule of law.”  
— Michael Greco 

> “Of one thing we may be sure, the future will never have to ask, with misgiving, what could the Nazis have said in their favor? History will know that whatever could be said, they were allowed to say. they have been given the kind of trial which they in the day of their pomp and power, never gave to any man.”  
— Justice Jackson, quoted by Michael Greco
