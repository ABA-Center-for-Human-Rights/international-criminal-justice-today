On February 25, the ABA held a discussion on the Bangladesh War Crimes Tribunal at Georgetown University Law Center. The purpose of the discussion was to address the shortcomings of the Tribunal and to present some of its accomplishments. For instance, moderator Michael Greco, former ABA president and chair of the ABA-ICC Project, pointed out that the mandate of this course came on the heels of the Bangladesh Atrocities, beginning back in the 1970s; this type of legislation was a rarity at that time, predating all modern international criminal tribunals by decades. Criticisms of the Bangladesh Tribunal stem primarily from the procedures being employed by the Tribunal, which give the appearance of impropriety. As former Defense Team Attorney Toby Cadman suggested in quoting Justice Jackson, “If you are determined to execute a man in any event, there is no occasion to hold a trial.” Full video of the panel can be found below.

> "I completely agree that I dont think it matters how long we wait, there should be a system. Whether its five years or forty years, I think that the fact that forty three years has passed is not a reason not to establish a process.”

— Justice Jackson as quoted by Toby Cadman                                                                                                                                                              

> “The legislation prohibits any challenge to the legislation itself, to the jurisdiction of the tribunal, and to the appointment of any particular judge. Taking an extreme example, we are prevented from challenging and seeking the removal of a judge on any ground.”
