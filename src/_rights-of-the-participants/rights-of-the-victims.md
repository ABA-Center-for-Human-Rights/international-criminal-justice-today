International atrocity crimes can devastate families, communities, and even entire countries. Thousands, if not millions, of people often lose their lives. For those that live, torture, rape and other brutal acts leave them with life-long physical and psychological scars. Communities also lose property and other material of immense importance, such as places of worship, hospitals, and schools.

Victims are a central purpose of the ICC’s existence. It is no surprise then that Victims have a significant amount of rights at the ICC, including the ability to participate in the proceedings, to have their voices heard, and to receive reparations for their losses.

# Who can be a “victim” at the ICC?

- Any individual who has suffered harm as a result of crimes committed in connection with a particular case before the ICC. Also, organizations or institutions can be victims if their property was harmed by a crime before the ICC. The property must be religious, educational, medical, art, scientific, humanitarian, historic.

# What rights do victims have at the ICC?

- Victims have the right to be recognized by the ICC as “victims” and to have legal representation appointed. Lawyers for victims often represent groupings of victims.

ICC Office of Public Counsel for Victims has a helpful [guide](http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure%2520of%2520the%2520court/victims/office%2520of%2520public%2520counsel%2520for%2520victims/Documents/26-March-2013-EN-Consolidated-Version-2010-2012-OPCVManual.pdf) about representing victims at the ICC, including how to register to represent victims.

- Once recognized, victims and their lawyers can request the Judges to impose any and all possible measures to respect and protect their safety, well‐being, dignity and privacy in the course of their participation in the proceedings, such as not to disclose their identity to the public, Prosecution, or Defense.

- At the discretion of judges, victims and their lawyers can request to participate in any stage of the proceedings when their personal interests are affected. This right includes the ability to:

	- Attend and participate in hearings

	- Make opening and closing statements

	- Give observations on critically important parts of the proceedings, including: whether the ICC has jurisdiction or the case is admissible; whether evidence exist to proceed with an investigation; what charges should be filed; and ask questions to any witness or accused individual.

# What are “reparations” and how are reparations awarded at the ICC?

- Reparations can be any award deemed appropriate under the circumstances by the Judges, including restitution, compensation, and rehabilitation.

- Reparations can only be awarded at the end of a trial and only in relation to crimes for which an accused is convicted.

- In the case of indigent defendants, reparations can be awarded through the ICC Trust Fund for Victims

- The Trust Fund for Victims can also provide general assistance to victims independently.


_The ICC Trust Fund for Victims has its own [website](http://www.trustfundforvictims.org/) with more information, including how to make a charitable donation to the Fund._
