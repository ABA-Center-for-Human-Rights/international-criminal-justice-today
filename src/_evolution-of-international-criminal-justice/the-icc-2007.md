##### 2007

January 23 2007: The Republic of Lebanon and the United Nations signed an [Agreement establishing the Special Tribunal for Lebanon](http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N07/363/57/PDF/N0736357.pdf?OpenElement). The Special Tribunal for Lebanon is an hybrid international tribunal, having jurisdiction over 'persons responsible for the attack of 14 February 2005 resulting in the death of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri and in the death and injury of other persons,' and potentially over any attacks the tribunal determines are related. The tribunal was established following an investigation of the February 14, 2005 terrorist attack by Lebanese authorities and the UN International Independent Investigation Commission and several other attacks in Lebanon, which prompted the Republic of Lebanon to request that the UN create a tribunal of 'international character.'
