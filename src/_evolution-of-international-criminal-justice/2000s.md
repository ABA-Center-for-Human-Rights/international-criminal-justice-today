June 30, 2000: As required by the Final Act of the Rome Conference, the Preparatory Commission adopted draft texts for International Criminal Court’s Rules of Procedure and Evidence and the Elements of Crimes. The Assembly of States Parties later adopted these texts during their first session in September 2002.

June 6, 2000: The [United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor](http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N99/312/77/PDF/N9931277.pdf?OpenElement) (UNTAET) [established the Special Panels for Serious Crimes (SPSC)](http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/etimor/untaetR/Reg0015E.pdf) within the Dili District Court of East Timor. The Special Panels for Serious Crimes was a hybrid court, having jurisdiction over “serious crimes” drawn from both international and domestic law committed in the territory of East Timor from January 1, 1999 to October 25, 1999. The Special Panels were established following widespread violence and atrocities after a 1999 referendum in which East Timor voted to become independent from Indonesian occupation.
