The International Criminal Court (ICC) Project converts the ABA’s strong policies on the ICC into concrete action. Its mission is to strengthen, regularize, and broaden U.S. engagement with the ICC by creating dynamic forums where meaningful and sustained dialogue can occur on both practical and policy issues among and between the ICC and various American audiences. These initiatives will advance the field of international criminal law as well as enhance understanding and trust between the U.S. and the ICC.

### International Criminal Justice: Mass Atrocities, the International Criminal Court, and the Role of States

On April 10, 2014, the ABA-ICC Project, the Aspen Institute Justice and Society Program, the Coalition for the International Criminal Court (CICC), and the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands co-sponsored two panel programs in Washington, DC. at an event entitled "International Criminal Justice: Mass Atrocities, the International Criminal Court, and the Role of States" that was hosted by the Jones Day law firm at their beautiful offices overlooking the US Capitol.

The first panel program was devoted to the US role in international criminal justice.  The distinguished panelists were the Hon. Patricia Wald, former judge of the US Court of Appeals - DC Circuit and of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), and Stephen Rapp, US Ambassador for Global Criminal Justice. The program was moderated by Stephen Lamony of the CICC.

The second panel program focused on the successes and challenges at the ICC, and the distinguished panelists were Fatou Bensouda, Prosecutor of the ICC, and Justice Richard Goldstone, former Prosecutor of both the ICTY and International Criminal Tribunal for Rawanda.  The program was moderated by former ABA President Michael S. Greco, Chair of the ABA-ICC Project and its Board of Advisors.

During the panel discussion some of the issues among many addressed by Prosecutor Bensouda were the politicization of the ICC, the lack of adequate resources for the ICC, and the misconceptions of the Court’s operations which are undermining the ICC and its important casework:  “Misconceptions are another challenge that the court is facing. I think one of the biggest enemies of the court - if I may put it that way - are the misconceptions or misperceptions or deliberately making sure that the Court is not understood. We need cooperation from states to make sure that the limitations of the court are understood.” 

One subject among others addressed by Justice Goldstone was the evolution of the US-ICC relationship:  “I can’t exaggerate the importance that the US has played in the field of international criminal justice. I would go so far as to say that without the United States, we would not have a field of international criminal justice at all.”  The video of the highly informative full program may be viewed below.
