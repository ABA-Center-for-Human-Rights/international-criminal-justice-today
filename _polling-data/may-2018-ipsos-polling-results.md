## April 2019 Ipsos Polling Results

#### Most recent polling shows continued or increased American appreciation and support for the ICC, and a surprising number of all Americans supporting an ICC investigation in Afghanistan of alleged crimes committed by all parties, including American personnel.&nbsp;

In the latest round of Ipsos polling done for the American Bar Association’s International Criminal Court (ICC) Project, Americans’ knowledge, acceptance, and support for the ICC has either stayed at elevated levels or increased since polling began in 2014. Also, surprisingly, the largest segment of all Americans supported an ICC investigation of alleged crimes in Afghanistan regardless if the target of such an investigation was Americans or members of “terrorist” groups like the Taliban or Islamic State.

##### Knowledge and Awareness of the ICC

From this most recent polling, there were modest increases in the overall American awareness of the ICC itself. Just under half of Americans (45%) are aware of the Court, up from 40% when this tracking began in 2014. Despite this increased awareness, there continues to be an incorrect belief among Americans (almost four out of ten) that United States is a member of the ICC.

Awareness of the ICC continues to be strongest among millennials (age 18-34) with 57% awareness and among men with 27% awareness.

##### Perceptions of the Court’s Objectives

In our last polling in July 2017, there was a 15% increase in Americans’ belief that the United States should dedicate resources, including financial, military and intelligence, to international organizations that support human rights and that hold individuals accountable for mass atrocities. That number increased slightly in this last polling to 16% (47% in 2014 to 63% today).

##### Perception of the Court and US Membership

In both the July 2017 polling and in this most recent polling, there was an increase in all Americans’ belief that the US should join the ICC or become more involved in the Court (from 34% in July2017 & February 2014 to 50% in May 2018). This increase appears to come from the undecided crowd; today, less Americans have an opinion on this matter with only 29% reporting “I don’t know”, down from 42% in 2014.

The sentiment that the US should join or more fully support the ICC is especially strong among those who are aware of the ICC (64%). Yet, for those aware of the Court, 37% believe joining the ICC would compromise US sovereignty, but only 18% of this group believes the US should not join the ICC.

##### Support of ICC potentially investigating members of the Taliban/Islamic States, United States Armed Forces, and the CIA

The most surprising results of this poll came from the current event questions, which this time around revolved around the ICC’s potential investigation in Afghanistan. Predictably, a strong majority of Americans (68%) support the ICC opening an investigation in Afghanistan of alleged crimes committed by members of the Taliban or so-called Islamic State, with 42% reporting they strongly support it.

However, 45% of all Americans either strongly or somewhat supported the ICC investigating alleged crimes committed in Afghanistan by member of the US military or CIA, whereas only 21% of all Americans strongly or somewhat opposed an investigation of Americans.

Likely a bigger surprise was that all Americans’ opinions either did not change or became more favorable to the ICC (81%) after being informed that the Court would potentially investigate alleged crimes committed by members of all groups involved, namely the US military, CIA, Taliban, and Islamic State. 50% of all Americans said this information did not change their opinion of the ICC; 31% said it made their opinion of the ICC much or somewhat more favorable; 19% said it made their opinion of the Court much or somewhat less favorable.
