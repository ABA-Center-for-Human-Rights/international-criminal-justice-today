The full day, international conference in Paris, France, on March 21, 2013 brought together experts in the field of corporate liability in conflict zones. After the conference, Madam Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Fatou Bensouda (The Gambia) sat down for an interview and explained that alleged ignorance is no defense when it comes to corporate liability. She called for a more proactive approach by corporations stating that, “I think that private companies can actually do a lot to ensure that the access that those in the conflict have to weapons, to money, to the illegal trade, is not enhanced. At least,” she went on, “they can start by doing that.” Madam Prosecutor stated that she would not at all be opposed to corporate liability being a future subject in the ICC, at least for those who directly contribute to these atrocities in conflict zones.

That made it very hard to do other things that we wanted to do there, to restore the rule of law.&rdquo; &mdash; Mr. Rapp</p></figure>
