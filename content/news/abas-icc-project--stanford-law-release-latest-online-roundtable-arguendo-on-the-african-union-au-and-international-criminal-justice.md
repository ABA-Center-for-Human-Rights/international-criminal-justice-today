#### **The ABA’s ICC Project & Stanford Law release most recent** Arguendo **on the recent tension between the AU and** the International Criminal Court**.**

Washington D.C., Dec. 8, 2014 – The [American Bar Association’s International Criminal Court (ICC) Project](http://www.aba-icc.org/) and [Stanford Law School Program in International and Comparative Law](https://law.stanford.edu/stanford-program-in-international-and-comparative-law/) are pleased to announce the release of the latest online expert roundtable, *[Arguendo](http://www.international-criminal-justice-today.org/arguendo/)*, on the relationship between the African Union and the International Criminal Court.

<br>To discuss the future of the African Union and the International Criminal Court, a highly distinguished panel was assembled: Professor Beth Van Schaack, former Deputy to the Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues; Professor David Bosco, Assistant Professor at American University’s School of International Service; Ottilia Anna Maunganidze, Researcher the Institute for Security Studies (ISS); and Professor M. Kamari Clarke, Professor of Anthropology and International and Area Studies at Yale University.

In her article, Professor Van Schaack [examines](https://www.international-criminal-justice-today.org/arguendo/african-heads-of-state-before-the-international-criminal-court/) the background and legality of arrest warrants for sitting Heads of State of African nations. Professor David Bosco [argues](https://www.international-criminal-justice-today.org/arguendo/time-for-the-african-union-to-choose-a-path/) that the African countries critical of the ICC should either accept the jurisdiction of the Court or reconsider their statuses as States Parties, rather than continuing a tense relationship. Ms. Maunganidze [cautions](https://www.international-criminal-justice-today.org/arguendo/the-conflation-of-politics-and-law-africa-and-international-criminal-justice/) against an oversimplification of the relationship, pointing to the variety of approaches to cooperation with the Court among African nations. Professor Clarke [advocates](https://www.international-criminal-justice-today.org/arguendo/accountability-and-the-expansion-of-the-criminal-jurisdiction-of-the-african-court/) for the establishment of an African court with criminal jurisdiction that works alongside the ICC.
