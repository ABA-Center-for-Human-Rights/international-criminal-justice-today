https://www.aba-icc.org/https://www.aba-icc.org/The ABA calls upon governments around the world – including the United States – to join and support the ICC, provide resources to its annual budget, cooperate fully with its proceedings and implement the Rome Statute fully at the national level in accordance with the complementarity principle. Only through such robust support can justice be assured for victims of atrocity crimes, and would-be perpetrators be deterred.To commemorate International Criminal Justice Day 2017, the President of the American Bar Association (ABA) Linda A. Klein [issued](https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2017/07/statement_of_abapre.html) a statement reaffirming the ABA's longstanding belief in the "essential role" of the rule of law in confronting mass atrocities, and calling on governments to do more to support the International Criminal Court (ICC) and other global efforts to end impunity for, and bring justice to the victims of, the atrocity crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.

In her capacity as the voice of the ABA, President Klein's statement stressed the law cannot be ignored when facing atrocity crimes, "[t]he ABA has long believed that peace and security are best achieved and maintained through the rule of law." Her statement continues by stating that while the ICC needs to improve its performance, it is States that carry the burden of supporting the Court properly for it to fulfill its mandate. "As recognized by the court itself, much work remains to be done in enhancing its effectiveness and efficiency. Yet the nations of the world also have much more to do in cooperating and assisting ICC investigations and prosecutions, as well as in developing complementary national capacity to pursue accountability for atrocity crimes."

Noting the recent meetings held at the ABA and at the ICC with leadership of both organizations, President Klein said the ABA "look[ed] forward to building on an already strong relationship..." that exists with the ICC.

She concluded her statement with a strong message to governments around the world to do more to support international criminal justice, most notably the ICC and its cases, "[t]he ABA calls upon governments around the world – including the United States – to join and support the ICC, provide resources to its annual budget, cooperate fully with its proceedings and implement the Rome Statute fully at the national level in accordance with the complementarity principle. Only through such robust support can justice be assured for victims of atrocity crimes, and would-be perpetrators be deterred."
